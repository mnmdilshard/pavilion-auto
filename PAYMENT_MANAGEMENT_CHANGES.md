# Payment Management Changes

## Overview
As of June 23, 2025, we have streamlined the payment management process by removing the dedicated "Bank Transfers" and "LC Payments" tabs. All payment management is now centralized through the Invoices system.

## Key Changes
1. Removed standalone "Bank Transfers" and "LC Payments" pages
2. Consolidated payment management into the Invoices page

## How to Manage Payments
### Recording Payments
1. Navigate to the **Invoices** page
2. Find the relevant invoice
3. Click the "Record Payment" button
4. Select the payment type (LC or Bank Transfer)
5. Enter payment details and submit

### Viewing Payment Status
- Payment status indicators (LC Paid, Bank Transfer Paid) continue to appear on the vehicle list
- Payment details are still visible in the Vehicle Details view

## Technical Implementation
The underlying data structures and backend APIs for LC Payments and Bank Transfers remain unchanged. Only the dedicated UI pages were removed to streamline the user experience.

This change reduces interface complexity while maintaining all payment functionality through the more comprehensive Invoices system.
