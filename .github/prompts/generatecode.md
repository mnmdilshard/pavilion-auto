# Pavilion Auto Application Development Prompt

I'm developing "Pavilion Auto", a vehicle import management application that tracks the complete lifecycle of importing vehicles from Japan to Sri Lanka. To ensure effective assistance without public code errors, I'd like guidance on implementing specific components of this project.

## Project Overview
Pavilion Auto will manage:
- Vehicle details throughout their import lifecycle
- Seller/vendor relationships and payment tracking
- LC (Letter of Credit) documentation and status
- Bank transfers and deposits
- Investor management and profit sharing
- Import taxes and additional charges
- Comprehensive reporting and dashboards

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite (local setup)


## Current Focus Area
For this specific request, I need guidance on:

[SELECT ONE SPECIFIC AREA]
1. **Database Schema Design**: Specifically for the [specific table] table
2. **Project Structure**: Recommended folder organization for [backend/frontend]
4. **API Design**: RESTful endpoint patterns for [specific module]
5. **React Component Architecture**: For [specific feature] module
6. **Business Logic Implementation**: Approach for [specific calculation/function]
7. **State Management**: Patterns for [specific data flow]

## Request Type
Please provide:
- Architecture recommendations
- Design patterns
- Implementation concepts
- Best practices
- Sample structure (not complete implementations)

I'm looking for guidance on patterns and approaches rather than complete code implementations to avoid public code errors while building this application incrementally.
